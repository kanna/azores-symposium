\section{Budget}
\label{sec:budget}

While the \symp will be a considerable time commitment, one way we
hope to attract the 'right' people is by having the event fully funded
to cover air travel to/from Terceira, hotel stay, conference venue,
all meals and social events for all participants. To ensure we have
outreach to the next generation of researchers, we will competitively
select 3 graduate students from under-represented communities in the
ocean sciences and technology. We estimate this event to cost a modest
$\sim$ US \$73K. The breakdown of the budget is in Table
\ref{tab:budget}.
