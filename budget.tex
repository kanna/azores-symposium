While the \symp might be a considerable time commitment, one way we hope
to attract the 'right' people is by having the event fully funded to
cover air travel to/from Terceira, hotel stay, conference venue, all
meals and social events. We estimate this to cost $\sim
\$70K$. Potential sponsors include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]

  \item US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and ONR Global
  \item Research Council Norway (RCN)
  \item Regional govt. of Azores
  \item Portuguese Government
  \item Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology (FCT)
  \item European Union networking funding (EU)

\end{itemize}

The breakdown of the budget is in Table \ref{tab:budget}.
