  \caption{Estimated costs for the \sympe. We expect 27 scholars
    spread across disciplines, geography and gender and 3 graduate
    students (to be competitively selected) at the
    meeting. \ic{\textsuperscript{*}}Given the pandemic, the location
    of the symposium is still tentative at this time.}

While the \symp might be a considerable time commitment, one way we
hope to attract the 'right' people is by having the event fully funded
to cover air travel to/from Terceira, hotel stay, conference venue,
all meals and social events for all participants. To ensure we have
outreach to the next generation of researchers, will competitively
select 3 graduate students from around the world to attent. We
estimate this event to cost a modest $\sim$ US \$73K. The breakdown of
the budget is in Table \ref{tab:budget}.
